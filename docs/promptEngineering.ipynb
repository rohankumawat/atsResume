      "{\"JD Match\":\"75%\",\"MissingKeywords\":[\"data mining\",\"algorithms\",\"cross-functional teamwork\",\"regional market strategies\",\"platform security\"],\"Profile Summary\":\"Rohan Kumawat's resume indicates a strong foundation in machine learning engineering with hands-on experience in recommendation systems and a variety of machine learning projects. He has a solid technical skill set relevant to the job description, including Python, SQL, and experience with TensorFlow, which aligns with the requirements for developing machine learning models at TikTok. His education background with a Master's in Robotics and A.I. is well-suited for the role. However, there are some missing keywords that are crucial for the job at TikTok, such as experience in data mining, algorithms, and an understanding of platform security. Additionally, evidence of cross-functional teamwork and strategies for regional market growth are not explicitly mentioned, which are important for the role that collaborates with cross-functional teams at TikTok. Enhancing the resume to include these elements would likely improve the match percentage.\"}"
